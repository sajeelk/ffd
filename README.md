# Aim--How project works
A simple python program that takes a sqlite db file and writes it to a <b>F</b>lat <b>F</b>ile <b>D</b>estination (text file) with the allotted field lengths.
(It makes more sense after you run the program.)


## What You Need
1. A sqlite db file.
2. A sql query that selects (and/or formats) the fields.
3. A text file that contains the maximum field lengths, seperated by commas.
4. A clone of this repo
5. Python installed on your system

## Running
1. Go to the command line.
2. cd into the directory you cloned the repo to.
3. Type ```python untitled.py```
4. Enter the info.
5. The End.
